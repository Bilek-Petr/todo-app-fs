## Users should be able to:

   ✔ Add new todos to the list
   
   ✔ Mark todos as complete
   
   ✔ Delete todos from the list
   
   ✔ Filter by all/active/complete todos
   
   ✔ Clear all completed todos
   
   ✔ Toggle light and dark mode
   
   ✔ View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
   
   ✔ See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
   
   ✔ Bonus: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

   ✔ Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application
   
   ✔ As a bonus I've decided to limit input length and item edit length

## How to use the App
- in root directory run command npm start, which starts both backend and frontend server.
