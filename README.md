Basic fullstack todo app 
The task is from https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW



Your users should be able to:

   ✔ Add new todos to the list
   ✔ Mark todos as complete
   ✔ Delete todos from the list
   ✔ Filter by all/active/complete todos
   ✔ Clear all completed todos
   ✔ Toggle light and dark mode
   ✔ View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
   ✔ See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
   ✔ Bonus: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
   ✔ Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application
   ✔ As a bonus I've decided to limit input length and item edit length
